            DBF2CSV v5 is a program to convert .DBF database
              files to .CSV (comma-separated text) format

                             --------------

Installation instructions for DBF2CSV:


1) Open a "DOS Box" (command line).

2) Put all six files in a directory on your PATH:

     DBF2CSV.TXT  (this file)
     DBF2CSV.BAT  (a batch file to run DBF2CSV, for convenience)
     DBF2CSV.PL   (the DBF2CSV program, written in Perl)
     PERL4S.EXE   (a small 16-bit DOS implementation of Perl)
     PERL4W.EXE   (a small 16-bit Windows implementation of Perl)
     PERL4W32.EXE (a small Win32 implementation of Perl)

   (Note: you can unzip the files from DBF2CSV.ZIP using pkunzip
   or WinZip, but if you are reading this file then you've
   probably already figured that out.)

3) If you just want to run DBF2CSV from a command prompt, then
   that's all you need to do to install it.

   If you want to run DBF2CSV as a Windows program, then you need
   to create a Start Menu shortcut.  If your current directory is
   c:\mydir\ then the shortcut should run it like this:

        c:\mydir\perl4w32.exe c:\mydir\dbf2csv.pl -p

   To create the shortcut, go to:
     Start ->
       Settings ->
         {Taskbar or Start Menu} ->
            {Advanced or Start Menu Programs}
   ...and then Add the program to your start menu.


                             --------------


For usage instructions from a command prompt, run it with no parameters:

     DBF2CSV

Then, to convert a .dbf file, just run it with the name of the .dbf file:

     DBF2CSV afile.DBF

That's all there is to it.


                             --------------


Note #1:  If you use a 16-bit Perl implemention such as Perl4s.exe or
Perl4w.exe then this program is limited to the use of "8.3" (short)
file names.  If you need to use long file names, then you must use a
32-bit version of Perl, such as Perl4W32.exe.

Note #2:  The source code for Perl4s.exe and Perl4w.exe (and a few
more versions of Perl 4.036) is available at http:\www.burtonsys.com\
Click on "Support" and "Downloads" and then "more files... (auxiliary
download page)".
